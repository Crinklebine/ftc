Full Timeframe Continuity Script for Tradingview

The FTC indicator is for detecting Full Timeframe Continuity on a 60 min chart.

The indicator checks the current candle color of the daily, weekly and monthly charts while on the 60 minute chart.

If all of the 60 minute, daily, weekly and monthly candles are of the same color then there is a Full Timeframe Continuity.
Thus a chart can have FTC Up, FTC Down or be neutral.

A neutral condition occurs when there is at least one candle color in opposition on the 60 minute, daily, weekly or monthly timeframes.

The FTC indicator is visible on the top of the chart above the current candle.

Colors have been selected to display as best as possible on both black as well as white backgrounds.

Green indicates FTC Up.
Red indicates FTC Down.
Yellow indicates FTC Neutral.

Colors, symbols and positions can be configured with a configuration menu.

The indicator can be applied to any timeframe chart. However, nothing will be displayed unless the timeframe is 60 minutes.
